## 4. Project Activities / Deliverables 

### 4.1 Project Proposal

- Due: 11/10
- The project proposal is worth **12%** of the project grade.

Your proposal should contain seven parts, as specified below. The document need not be very long, but the more detail you include, the better feedback we can provide for your team:

1. **The Big Idea**: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.
The main idea of my project is to automate the process of sending post-exam emails for my Department of Accessibility proctoring job using Python. The MVP includes automated email generation and a basic, color-coded table of attending students, while the stretch goal involves enhancing the interface using GUI displays or Django or Flask.
2. **Learning Objectives**: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

My learning goal for this project includes gaining proficiency in automating tasks with Python, understanding email automations, working with data manipulation using libraries like 'pandas', and possibily exploring basic GUI development. Additionally, I aim to enhance problem-solbing skills through addressing real-world challenges in my proctoring job.

3. **Implementation Plan**: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.

In my initial research, I've identified Python libraries like 'smtplib', 'yagmail', and 'pandas' as potentially helpful for automating emails and handling the data given. I plan to use YouTube as a resource because there are countless videos about automating emails in Python to continute to learn more about potential libraries for this project.

4. **Project Schedule**: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.

**Week 1: November 15 - November 22**

- **Day 1-2 (Nov 15-16):** Finalize team formation, set up the GitHub repository, and schedule a meeting with the professor. Begin researching Python libraries (`smtplib`, `yagmail`, and `pandas`) for email automation and data manipulation.

- **Day 3-5 (Nov 17-19):** Dive deeper into research on chosen Python libraries. Explore documentation and examples to better understand their usage and integration into the project.

- **Day 6-7 (Nov 20-22):** Start coding the minimum viable product (MVP). Implement the foundation for email automation using `smtplib` or `yagmail` and basic data manipulation using `pandas`. Create a simple command-line interface for testing.

**Week 2: November 23 - November 29**

- **Day 8-10 (Nov 23-25):** Test the initial MVP internally within the team. Identify and address any issues or improvements needed.

- **Day 11-14 (Nov 26-29):** Continue coding to enhance the MVP. Implement additional features for the stretch goal, focusing on user-friendly interfaces, enhanced customization, and advanced functionalities.

**Week 3: November 30 - December 6**

- **Day 15-17 (Nov 30 - Dec 2):** Conduct thorough testing of the entire project. Address any remaining issues and refine user interfaces.

- **Day 18-20 (Dec 3-5):** Work on the mid-project presentation. Highlight the project's evolution, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

- **Day 21-22 (Dec 6):** Conduct the mid-project presentation, gather feedback, and submit the required materials online. Ensure all documentation is up-to-date.


5. **Collaboration Plan**: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.
I plan to work alone on this project because what I want to code is so specific to me and my job. 
6. **Risks and Limitations**: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?
The most significants threat to the success of this project is likely my own procrastination. Staying disciplined and managing my time effectively, especially as the end of the semester creeps forward, will be crucial to meet deadlines and ensure consistent progress. This is a complex project with new libraries and concepts that I am not familiar with and given that I need to spend a good amount of time learning and researching as well as implementing these ideas. I think the timeline will be a good resource to help keep me on track.

7. **Additional Course Content**: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?
I think a big helper from this course will be how we just used Flask to build a simple website which has given me experience in UX design and web development. While Flask and GUI are distinct and different, the understanding gained from creating a web interface enhances my ability to design a user-friendly interface for the automated proctoring email system. Also what I've learned about dictionaries will be helpful for managing and organizing student data for my system. Using dicts I will be able to easily store and retrieve information about each student, ensuring a structured and accessible data format that simplifies the automation process.
 
The proposal must be written using [markdown format](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). We recommend checking out [https://markdown-it.github.io](https://markdown-it.github.io) if you need more help with markdown syntax. You need to commit and push this proposal to your project GitHub repository. Everyone needs to submit the URL of the proposal to Canvas for grading purposes.

You should also come to class with a printed version of this proposal. We will have about 10 minutes to meet with each team. You should designate one of the two team members to take notes.
